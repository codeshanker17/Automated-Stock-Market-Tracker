# Automated-Stock-Market-Tracker
The project is a Python-based automated trading simulation that utilizes historical stock data to test a simple trading strategy. It fetches stock data for a specific symbol (e.g., Apple Inc. - AAPL) over a one-year period, calculates technical indicators like the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Relative Strength Index (RSI), and simulates buying and selling based on these indicators. The portfolio starts with an initial amount of cash and makes trading decisions, buying when conditions indicate a potential uptrend and selling when a downtrend is likely. The final portfolio value is calculated to evaluate the strategy's performance.

I developed this project as my semester's industrial training and i learnt about buying, selling of shares, managing portfolio, etc.
